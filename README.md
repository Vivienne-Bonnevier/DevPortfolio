A collection of works to display my talents

JS_VideoPoker is mainly a JavaScript project with light HTML and CSS aspects. It showcases use of API use, JSON objects, sorting and displaying info, and lots of logic to check for various Poker hands.

PersonalPage is a project highlighting visual design with HTML/CSS and Python (via Flask), including use of WTForms for form submission and validation, SQLite databases (using SQLAlchemy) to store user submitted data, and jinja templates to provide easy html structuring.

Static HTML pages without using Flask are still available under the Static folder https://github.com/Vivienne-Bonnevier/DevPortfolio/tree/main/PersonalPage/static
